# Sketches

This repository is a sketch area to catch short Python experiments as I explore different ideas.

## Structure

Each topic gets its own subdirectory. Create a new subdirectory as the topic changes.

Example structure:

```text
sketches/
├── topic_one/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── experiment.py
├── topic_two/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── script.py
└── ...
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a new subdirectory for your topic area
2. Add your Python experiments in that directory
3. Include a README.md to document what you're exploring

See `example_topic/` for a simple starting template.
